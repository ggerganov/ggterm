# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Thick
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium
# font_family      Input Mono
# font_family      Fantasque Sans Mono

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
#symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols
